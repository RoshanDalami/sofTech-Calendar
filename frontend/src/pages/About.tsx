        <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold dark:text-white">About Miti:</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
          Miti was created out of a personal need to bridge the gap between two calendars that Nepali
          individuals live by. I was looking for a minimalist Nepali calendar app that would allow me to sync
          events with google calendar. Imagine a scenario, you have an appointment for a meeting with Ram on
          Asadh 15 and you want to create a reminder, it requires you to first convert the date to the
          Gregorian calendar and then create a reminder on your calendar app. I proposed to develop a minimal
          calendar app as a part of our open source effort to the team at POSK. The team understood the
          challenges faced when scheduling events or appointments in one calendar system and trying to
          decipher the corresponding date in the other and Miti started out as a soluton. Miti is here to
          simplify your life by seamlessly syncing events between the Nepali and Gregorian calendars.

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Sync and Simplify:</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
          Miti isn't an attempt to simply replace all the calendars you use, but rather a tool to help you
          create and browse your events in the Nepali calendar system. Miti goes beyond the traditional
          calendar app functionalities by offering a seamless integration with Google Calendar. By syncing
          your events with Google Calendar, you can easily access and manage your schedule across different
          operating systems and calendar apps that support Google Calendar integration. No matter where you
          are or which device you're using, Miti ensures that your events are always synchronized and up to
          date. That way, you can inter-operate between the Nepali and Gregorian calendars without having to
          convert dates manually.

        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
          With Miti, creating events using the Nepali date and viewing them in the Gregorian date format and
          vice versa becomes effortless. You can simply input the Nepali date for your event in the Miti app,
          and it will automatically be converted to the corresponding Gregorian date in Google Calendar. Miti
          also provides a converter tool that allows you to convert dates between the Nepali and Gregorian
          calendar.

        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
          Miti not only allows you to create events in the Nepali calendar, but it also provides a
          comprehensive view of your Google Calendar events within the app. You can easily browse through your
          schedule, view event details, and manage your appointments, ensuring that you stay organized and
          never miss an important event.

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold dark:text-white">Simplicity and Efficiency:</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
          Unlike existing calendar apps that are often bloated and lack essential features, Miti focuses on
          being a minimalistic and efficient tool. We have intentionally limited the features to ensure that
          the app remains lightweight and minimal.

        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
          Miti leverages Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, enabling you to access the app even when you're
          offline. Whether you're on the go or in an area with limited connectivity, Miti ensures that you can
          still view and manage your events effortlessly. Additionally, you have the option to install Miti as
          a app on your device, allowing you to access the app directly from your home screen. This means that
          you can use Miti just like any other native app, without having to download it from the app store.
          And the best part is, it takes up less storage than a photo.
